              The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, is a mesmerizing natural
              light display predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around
              the Arctic. These lights occur when charged particles from the sun
              collide with atoms in the Earth's atmosphere, causing bursts of
              light. The colors vary from greens and pinks to purples and reds,
              creating a breathtaking spectacle in the night sky.

              The Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights, mirrors the Northern
              Lights but is visible in high-latitude regions around the
              Antarctic. Like its northern counterpart, this phenomenon results
              from the interaction between solar particles and the Earth's
              magnetic field, producing vivid displays of green, pink, and other
              colors in the southern sky.

              Bioluminescent beaches glow with an ethereal blue or green light,
              caused by tiny marine organisms called dinoflagellates. When these
              plankton are disturbed by waves or movement in the water, they
              emit light as a defense mechanism. This creates stunning, glowing
              shorelines that look like something out of a fantasy world.

              Volcanic lightning occurs within the ash clouds of a volcanic
              eruption. As ash particles collide and generate static
              electricity, lightning bolts streak through the plume, creating a
              dramatic and fiery display. This rare and powerful phenomenon is a
              reminder of the intense energy unleashed during volcanic
              eruptions.

              A solar eclipse happens when the moon moves between the Earth and
              the sun, casting a shadow on Earth and blocking the sun's light
              either partially or completely. Depending on the alignment, solar
              eclipses can be total, partial, or annular, each offering a unique
              view of the sun's obscured form.

              A lunar eclipse takes place when the Earth comes between the sun
              and the moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall on the moon.
              During a total lunar eclipse, the moon can take on a reddish hue,
              known as a "Blood Moon," due to the scattering of sunlight through
              the Earth's atmosphere.

              A rainbow is a beautiful arc of colors visible in the sky, created
              by the refraction, dispersion, and reflection of sunlight in water
              droplets. Typically seen after rain showers, rainbows display a
              spectrum of light with red on the outer edge and violet on the
              inner edge.

              A tornado is a violently rotating column of air extending from a
              thunderstorm to the ground. These destructive funnels can cause
              significant damage with their powerful winds, often leaving a path
              of devastation. Tornadoes are most common in areas like the
              central United States, known as "Tornado Alley."

              A hurricane is a large, powerful tropical storm characterized by
              strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges. Known as cyclones or
              typhoons in different parts of the world, hurricanes form over
              warm ocean waters and can cause widespread destruction when they
              make landfall.

              A lightning storm is marked by the presence of frequent lightning
              and thunder, often accompanied by heavy rain. Lightning occurs due
              to the discharge of electricity within clouds or between clouds
              and the ground, creating dramatic and sometimes dangerous weather
              conditions.

              A fogbow, sometimes called a "white rainbow," forms in fog rather
              than rain. It appears as a white or pale-colored arc, created by
              the diffraction of sunlight through tiny fog droplets. Unlike a
              typical rainbow, fogbows are less vivid and have more subtle
              colors.

              A fire rainbow, or circumhorizontal arc, is a colorful halo
              parallel to the horizon, formed by the refraction of sunlight
              through ice crystals in cirrus clouds. This phenomenon occurs when
              the sun is high in the sky, and the resulting rainbow-like effect
              can be a stunning and rare sight.
